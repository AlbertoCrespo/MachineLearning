ABOUT THIS FILES:

The process performed in this activity is as follows:

1) We first run the FeatureClass.py script with which, through the algorithm of km, we assign three different zones to the csv file of the characteristics obtained in activity 5, which contains the incidents by accident of 2006. As a result we obtain the file Csv FeaturesClass.csv.

2) Secondly we launched the DecisionTree.py script that executes a decision tree algorithm to the above information, with an entropy criterion. The resulting information is enclosed in a pdf file called Tree.pdf.


EXECUTION:

To execute the file you must write on the terminal the command "make all".
